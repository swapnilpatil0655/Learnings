# Example summary.txt

Replace this file with your own professional summary. This should be a comprehensive overview of:

- Your professional background and experience
- Technical skills and expertise areas  
- Notable projects and achievements
- Education and certifications
- Personal interests and values
- Career objectives and what you're looking for

Keep it conversational but professional - this forms the foundation of how your AI chatbot will represent you.

Example structure:
- Start with a brief intro (role, location, years of experience)
- Highlight key technical skills and tools
- Mention domain expertise and notable projects
- Include education/background
- Add personal touches (hobbies, interests, values)
- End with professional philosophy or what you're seeking

See the current summary.txt for a complete example.
