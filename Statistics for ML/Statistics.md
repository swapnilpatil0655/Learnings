📘 Introduction

Becoming a data scientist is one of the most frequently discussed topics on the internet today. At the heart of data science lies the ability to extract meaningful insights from data and make informed decisions. To achieve this, a strong foundation in statistics and mathematics is essential.

Statistics plays a crucial role in data science by providing reliable methods to understand data, identify patterns, and predict future outcomes. Even when dealing with large and complex datasets, statistical principles help guide analysis in the right direction. These principles are built upon proven theories and formulas developed by renowned scientists, making them dependable tools for data-driven reasoning.

While statistics alone does not define data science, mastery of core statistical concepts such as probability theory and regression analysis is a fundamental requirement for aspiring data scientists. This is why mathematics and statistics consistently appear as key components in data science learning frameworks.

This course is designed specifically to help learners—especially those without a strong mathematical background—build a solid foundation in statistics and mathematical reasoning required for data science.
